# Hangman Game

The provided code is a Hangman game program developed as a final project for a Computational Thinking for Engineering course. It is designed to be an interactive console-based game where the player guesses a movie title based on a chosen theme, such as superheroes, Disney and Pixar, horror, or movies for cinema experts. 

The game incorporates elements of repetition, file input/output, and user interaction. It starts by prompting the player to input their username and then guides them through the game's rules and instructions. The player selects a theme, and the program randomly selects a movie title from the corresponding file. The player then guesses letters to complete the movie title, with incorrect guesses resulting in the gradual drawing of a hangman figure. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses the movie or exhausts their allotted attempts.
